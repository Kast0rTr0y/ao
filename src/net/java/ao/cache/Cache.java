/**
 * <p>The super-interface for all value cache implementations.  Implementations of
 * this interface create an instance of {@link CacheLayer} for a given
 * {@link RawEntity}.  The design is such that any implementation of this interface
 * acts as the primary controller for the cache, delegating entity-specific tasks
 * to a custom implementation of <code>CacheLayer</code>.  Any resources which are
 * associated with a cache should be managed within the implementation of this
 * interface.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An example design would be for caching in a database (a patently useless
 * operation, given the function of the framework).  In this cache, the database
 * itself would be managed in the implementation of <code>ValueCache</code>.  This
 * class would then instantiate instances of a custom <code>CacheLayer</code>
 * implementation which would handle the actual act of caching data for specific
 * <code>RawEntity</code> instances (most likely each corresponding with a single
 * row).  By separating these implementations, it is possible keep resources
 * handled in a central controller while still devoting distinct memory space to
 * specific entities.  The distinct memory is most important in the default
 * implementation, {@link RAMCache}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Generically, implementations of <code>ValueCache</code> function as a
 * factory and controller for the relevant implementation of <code>CacheLayer</code>.
 * The primary purpose is to construct new instances of the implementation-specific
 * <code>CacheLayer</code> and to manage resources common to all constructed
 * instances.</p>

	 * this method should return an instance of a working <code>CacheLayer</code> 
	 * implementation which can persist values relevant to the given entity in an
	 * implementation-specific way.  For example, the default implementation of this
	 * interface ({@link RAMCache}) returns a <code>CacheLayer</code> which can

	 * <p>Typically, instances of the <i>same</i> implementation are returned for any
