/**
 * <p>The superinterface for all entities, regardless of primary key.  Developers
 * may choose to extend this interface rather than {@link Entity} if they
 * need to specify a custom primary key field.  As this interface is the most
 * generic superinterface in the entity hierarchy, it defines most of the 
 * common entity methods, such as {@link #save()} and 
 * {@link #addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener)}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This interface is parameterized for the sake of typechecking in the
 * {@link EntityManager#find(Class, String, Object...)} method.  The generic
 * type specified when inheriting this interface should be the same as the
 * return type of the primary key method.  Unfortunately, this is unenforcable,
 * so it is left up to the developers to ensure the spec is followed.</p>
