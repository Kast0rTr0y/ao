		<h1>Why ActiveObjects?</h1>
		
		<p>Possibily the most important question to answer regarding ActiveObjects is
		to explain: why another ORM?  The Java ORM framework genre is completely
		dominated by the JBoss framework, Hibernate.  In fact, Hibernate is so widely
		used and respected that it's even been ported to .NET (NHibernate).  So, if
		there's already a widely respected, widely used and mature framework which
		seems to satesfy all important use-cases, why throw another into the mix?</p>
		
		<p>The answer really comes back to complexity.  Hibernate is an incredibly
		complex framework.  Granted, it is complex mainly because it is powerful, but
		sometimes - most of the time even - the required use-case is very simple and
		doesn't require all of Hibernate's compexities.  ActiveObjects is designed from
		the ground up to be as easy to use as possible, with a bare minimum of
		configuration.  In fact, to date ActiveObjects doesn't even have a single hook
		which takes an XML (or any other format) configuration file.  Any and all
		configuration is either guessed from code, or easily set in code through the
		discrete use of annotations.</p>
		
		<p>There is an increasing trend in the industry towards "convention over
		configuration."  This is most reflected in RAD frameworks such as Ruby on Rails.
		Much of the accepted industry pundits agree that writing 20 lines of code is
		much easier than 20 lines of code and 150 lines of XML configuration (go
		figure).  ActiveObjects follows this practice as much as possible in its 
		implementation.  In fact, much of the inspiration for the framework comes
		from Rails's excelent ActiveRecord ORM (hence, the name).  The exception
		to this inspiration would be that ActiveObjects does <i>not</i> attempt to
		support English pluralization rules.  :-)</p>
		
		<p>In short, ActiveObjects attempts to make database development simple
		and fun again.  It abstracts the developer from the intricacies of the database
		schema and the particulars of how to access it.  Using ActiveObjects, the only
		thing the developer needs to worry about is the high-level concept of
		object-oriented data access.</p>
