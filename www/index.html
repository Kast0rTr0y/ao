		ActiveObjects is an intuitive, pure-Java database access layer.  AO is designed from the 
		ground up to be extremely simple and easy to use from an API standpoint.  AO also has 
		the potential to have significantly superior performance to more traditional DAOs such as 
		Hibernate because it is lazy-loaded with a multi-tiered caching system.  AO can be used 
		with either an existing database schema, or it can auto-generate the database schema 
		from the user-specified entity interfaces.
