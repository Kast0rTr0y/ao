		<h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
		
		<p>The underlying principle behind ActiveObjects is that ever-popular catch phrase:
		convention rather than configuration.  With ActiveObjects, you create the abstract Java
		class interfaces using standard Java data object conventions (<code>get</code>, <code>set</code>,
		<code>is</code>, etc...) and ActiveObjects handles the wiring to the database.  In
		fact, ActiveObjects will even generate the database-specific schema to correspond
		with the specified Java class model.</p>
		
		<p>From a developer standpoint, using ActiveObjects is as simple as the following:</p>
		
<pre>public interface Person extends Entity {
    public String getFirstName();
    public void setFirstName(String name);
    
    public String getLastName();
    public void setLastName(String name); 
}

// ...
EntityManager manager = new EntityManager("jdbc:mysql://localhost/ao_test", "user", "password");

Person frank = manager.create(Person.class);
frank.setName("Frank");
frank.setName("Smith");
frank.save();</pre>

		<p>The code specified above is fully functional; there are no unspecified configuration files.  In 
		fact, the only missing step would be to create the corresponding database schema.  ActiveObjects
		can handle this step too, using a feature called migrations:</p>
		
<pre>// ...
manager.migrate(Person.class);</pre>

		<p>This will execute DDL something like the following (assuming MySQL as in the URI above):</p>
		
<pre>CREATE TABLE person (
    id INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL,
    firstName VARCHAR(255),
    lastName VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);</pre>

		<p>With migrations, you don't need to worry about making changes to your schema, or keeping
		your schema in sync with your entity model in code.  Supposing you add a <code>getAge():int</code>
		method (and its corresponding setter) to the <code>Person</code> entity in the above example.
		If the <code>person</code> table has already been created, it probably contains data.  It would
		be ugly and painful to write scripts to generate a new version of the table, migrate the old
		data over and delete the old table.  Instead of this mess, all that is necessary is another
		call to the <code>migrate</code> method (as shown above).  This time, instead of generating
		the full table from scratch, ActiveObjects will inspect the existing schema and determine that
		the only necessary action is the addition of the <code>age</code> field.  To this end, it will
		execute <i>only</i> the following DDL statement:</p>

<pre>ALTER TABLE person ADD COLUMN age INTEGER;</pre>

		<p>All of the data has been retained, no ugly scripts were written and the entity model in
		code is once again in sync with the database schema.  This powerful functionality allows for
		things such as refactoring your entity model, adding constraints and indexes and so on all
		without adversely effecting your database.</p>

		<p>Switching databases is as easy as changing the JDBC URI value in the EntityManager constructor.  
		There is never any need to be concerned about the ins and outs of database specifics or
		to write any SQL by hand.  In fact, you can use ActiveObjects and take full advantage of
		database functionality without ever once opening a database client or even understanding the
		basics of SQL or RDBMS.</p>
		
		<p>In fact, any Java developer can use ActiveObjects, even if they have no experience whatsoever
		in databases or their underlying concepts.  The framework is designed so that it "feels" natural to any
		Java developer, not requiring any knowledge of relational databases.</p>
