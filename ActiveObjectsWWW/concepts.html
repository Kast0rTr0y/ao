		<h1>Basic Concepts</h1>
		
		<p>The underlying principle behind ActiveObjects is that ever-popular catch phrase:
		convention rather than configuration.  With ActiveObjects, you create the abstract Java
		class interfaces using standard Java data object conventions (<code>get</code>, <code>set</code>,
		<code>is</code>, etc...) and ActiveObjects handles the wiring to the database.  In
		fact, ActiveObjects will even generate the database-specific schema to correspond
		with the specified Java class model.</p>
		
		<p>From a developer standpoint, using ActiveObjects is as simple as the following:</p>
<pre>public interface Person extends Entity {
	public String getName();
	public void setName(String name);
}

EntityManager manager = new EntityManager("jdbc:mysql://localhost/ao_test", "user", "password");

Person frank = manager.create(Person.class);
frank.setName("Frank");</pre>

		<p>ActiveObjects entities can be treated as POJOs (Plain Old Java Object) without any fears
		surrounding change committing or data loss.</p>
		
		<p>The code specified above is fully functional; there are no unspecified configuration files.  In 
		fact, the only missing step would be to create the corresponding database schema.  ActiveObjects
		can handle this step too, ensuring that the database schema is perfectly in step with accepted
		database conventions as well as optimized to the particular database you may be using.  Generating
		the schema is as simple as the following invocation (also available as an Ant task):</p>
		
		<code>java -jar activeobjects-0.1.jar --classpath bin --uri jdbc:mysql://localhost/ao_test Person</code>
		
		<p>This utility will generate the following MySQL DDL statements:</p>
		
<pre>CREATE TABLE person (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	name VARCHAR(45),
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);</pre>

		<p>Switching databases is as easy as changing the JDBC URI value in the EntityManager constructor
		and in the schema generator utility.  There is never any need to be concerned about the ins and outs
		of database specifics.</p>
		
		<p>In fact, any Java developer can use ActiveObjects, even if they have no experience whatsoever
		in databases or their underlying concepts.  The framework is designed so that it "feels" natural to any
		Java developer, not requiring an advanced knowledge of relational databases.</p>
