Just felt it was worth taking the time to thank a few outstanding members of the ActiveObjects
community who have helped out over the course of the project.  This is hardly a comprehensive
list, just a few who spring to mind whenever I about the history of the project.  It's at least
safe to say that ActiveObjects would not be what it is today without these people.  To all of
you: you have my sincere thanks!
