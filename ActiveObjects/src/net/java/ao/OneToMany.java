/**
 * <p>Marks a method as relevant only to a one-to-many relation.  This
 * informs ActiveObjects that the return value for the method in question
 * should be determined from a one-to-many relation through the
 * specified type onto the type in the return value.  For example:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>public interface Company {
 *     // ...
 *     
 *     &amp;#064;OneToMany
 *     public Person[] getEmployees();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>Thus the return value of the <code>getEmployees()</code> method
 * would be determined by a query something like the following:</p>
 * 
 * <code>SELECT id FROM people WHERE companyID = ?</code>
 * 
 * <p>If the {@link #where()} clause is specified, it will be used
 * <i>in addition</i> to the base, necessary criterion to determine the
 * returned entities.  Thus, the one-to-many relation could be referenced
 * in the following way:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>public interface Company {
 *     // ...
 *     
 *     &amp;#064;OneToMany(where="deleted = FALSE")
 *     public Person[] getEmployees();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p>This would lead to a query like the following:</p>
 * 
 * <code>SELECT id FROM people WHERE companyID = ? AND (deleted = FALSE)</code>
