/**
 * <p>A superinterface for entities which are related to each other using
 * Lucene heuristics.  This is <i>not</i> required as a superinterface
 * for entities related to one another at the database level.  Thus, this
 * interface is only relevant to those already using full-text indexing.</p>
 * 
 * <p>While this entity does not extend {@link RawEntity} itself, it should
 * only be inherited by interfaces which do.  In fact, this is enforced by
 * the type parameterization of this interface.  Example:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>public interface Post extends Entity, RelatedEntity&lt;Post&gt; {
 *     // ...
 *     
 *     @Searchable
 *     @SQLType(Types.BLOB)
 *     public String getBody();
 *     
 *     @Searchable
 *     @SQLType(Types.BLOB)
 *     public void setBody(String body);
 * }
 * 
 * // ...
 * Post p = manager.get(Post.class, 123);
 * Post[] relatedPosts = p.getRelated();      // searches Lucene index for related posts</pre>
 * 
 * <p>Under most circumstances, the type parameter used when
 * inheriting from this interface should be the entity interface itself, as
 * in the above example.</p>
