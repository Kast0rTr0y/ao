		<p>The classes in this package are designed to be used internally by the
		ActiveObjects migrations mechanism.  While there's technically nothing
		preventing external use of the functionality provided by this package,
		the API was not designed with such usage in mind.  Additionally, the API
		defined by classes in this package should be considered "less stable" than
		the "official" public API.  While it is unlikely to change incompatibly
		between releases (as any DatabaseProvider will be effected by such change),
		less care will be taken in refactoring the API when necessary.  For the
		same reason, the public API is somewhat less thoroughly documented.</p>
