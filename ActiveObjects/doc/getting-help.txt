Getting Help
============

Regardless of how well designed a framework, sooner or later we all run into
trouble.  ActiveObjects has a number of venues through which assistance may be
obtained.

* **Users List** - users@activeobjects.dev.java.net
   
   This may very well be the best place to ask questions.  Often times, your
   question will be answered within a few hours either by a core developer or
   by another community member.  Additionally, it's usually worth checking the
   list archives; your question may have already been answered.
   
   This is also a very good place to discuss potential bugs and feature 
   requests.  The developers often use this list to get community feedback on
   new ideas and project planning.
   
* **Daniel Spiewak** - djspiewak@gmail.com
   
   As the originator of the project, Daniel loves getting email from people
   using ActiveObjects or considering it for any purpose.  Feel free to email
   him directly, but try the users list first if at all possible (that way your
   questions and the associated answers will be able to help someone else).
   
* **IssueTracker** - https://activeobjects.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues
   
   ActiveObjects uses the CollabNet IssueTracker software to track known bugs
   and feature requests.  If you believe you have found a bug in the framework,
   this is the place to report it.  Usually a developer will respond on the 
   issue within a few hours, either confirming or closing the issue (depending
   on the validity of the report).  Reporting a bug this way gives your issue
   the best chance of being addressed in a timely manner.
