Concepts
========

From the very beginning, one of the major considerations in the design of
ActiveObjects was conceptual consistency.  There are a number of API metaphors
which are established and strictly followed throughout the framework.  Once
these metaphors and their related design principles are understood, most of the
framework is intuitive to understand.


Overview
========

ActiveObjects is an *entity based* ORM.  That is to say, most of the useful work
is done by the actual entities and the underlying design of the framework is
oriented around facilitating entity manipulation.  Every entity type (as defined
by the interface itself extending ``Entity``) corresponds directly with a table
while every instance of that entity corresponds with a row in the table.  The
actual mapping between the entities and the database is done within the entities
themselves.  This is one of the defining properties of an active record ORM.

``EntityManager`` is the central controller for the entire framework.  Entities
are created, queried and destroyed by this class (field-level SELECTs and all
UPDATEs are performed within the entities themselves).  ``EntityManager``
delegates anything database-specific to the relevant implementation of
``DatabaseProvider``.  Most common use-cases for queries and high-level entity
manipulation can be satisfied by this class.
