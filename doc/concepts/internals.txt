Internals
=========
		
While the ActiveObjects API does allow for some rather unusual usage patterns
(such as the construction of entity definitions as pure Java interfaces), the code to
support this API isn't all that complex.  Much of the heart and soul of the ActiveObjects
library revolves around the concept of reflective instance proxying.

Instance proxying is a lesser known part of the Java reflection API which allows
a specified instance of the ``InvocationHandler`` class to intercept all
method calls to a contrived instance of a specified class type.  This is how the
``EntityManager`` can dynamically create an instance of an arbitrary
``Entity`` sub-interface.  In fact, the instance created by ``EntityManager``
is extremely special in that it will dynamically parse all method calls, attempting to
proxy the relevant calls down to the database.  This is how a call to an accessor within
an entity instance will immediately correspond to a call to the database.

The instance proxy ``InvocationHandler`` for ActiveObjects is the
``EntityProxy`` class.  ``EntityProxy`` has a single method -
``invoke`` - which receives all method calls to the corresponding ``Entity``
instance.  ``EntityProxy`` then applies a set of rules to the method name,
method annotations and method parameters to determine if it is a data accessor method.
If the method should correspond to a database function, ``EntityProxy`` handles
the retrieval of a database connection and the execution of the appropriate SQL.

For more details on ActiveObjects's implementation, refer to the 
javadocs_.
